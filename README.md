# Kanban ToDoList

## Overview

The Kanban TodoList project is a personal endeavor developed in Delphi, showcasing my skills in CRUD operations with a twist. This project goes beyond typical todo list functionalities by incorporating a Kanban board format, allowing for the management of multiple projects with visual Kanban boards. It's designed to offer a more dynamic and visual approach to project and task management.

## Features

- **Kanban Board Visualization**: Organize tasks visually across different stages of completion with drag-and-drop simplicity.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for managing tasks and projects efficiently.
- **Multiple Project Management**: Ability to manage several projects simultaneously, each with its own Kanban board.
- **Personal Project**: A showcase of my Delphi development skills, focusing on practical application of CRUD operations in a user-friendly interface.
